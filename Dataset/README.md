Modification:

The Dataset updated on 02/21/2019 by adding Capacity field on Discharge dataset and correct the cycle number.


02/21/2019 at 3:00 AM we add a new dataset call B0005_discharge.csv for B0005, every one cycle represent as one row.

02/23/2019 at 23:00, create a new dataset combination of charge and discharge, every cycle starts with charge operation and completed with discharge operation.

03/10/2019 at 13:30, reading papers about (RUL)

03/28/2019 at 11:00 AM started build different type of models to predict RUL (Classical ML).

04/04/2019 at 11:00 AM, Start build LSTM model to predict RUL.
