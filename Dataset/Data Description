Data Description:
A set of four Li-ion battery (#51) were run through 3 different operational profiles (charge, discharge and impedance)
at an ambient temperature of 4 deg C. Charging was carried out in a constant current (CC) mode at 1.5A until the battery 
voltage reached 4.2V and then continued in a constant voltage (CV) mode until the charge current dropped to 20mA. 

Fixed load current level of 2A was used and the discharge runs were stopped at 2V, 2.2V, 2.5V and 2.7V for battery 51
respectively. Impedance measurement was carried out through an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) frequency sweep 
from 0.1Hz to 5kHz. The experiments were carried out until the experiment control software crashed.

Note that there are several discharge runs where the capacity as well as voltage levels were very low. Reasons for this 
have not been fully analyzed.
